#Pomodori

This Javascript app will let you use a simple timer in the browser window
to keep track of your time like a pro, using the Pomodoro Technique.

##Usage

It's really easy to use, to begin the Pomodoro timer just press start.
The timer will countdown from 25 to 0.  Then click on the button for the
break time you want, and press start again.  Then, rinse and repeat 
until you have accomplished everything your heart desired!

Currently there is no support on Pomodori for keeping track of x's like 
you do with the Pomodoro technique, but that's not to say it will never
exist!
